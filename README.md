# Steven Lu - 2024W1 CPSC-210 Project: Assignment Tracking App 

## What will the application do?

This is an **assignment tracking application** that keeps track of a list of assignments to be done. The major feature is to record a list of assignments that haven't finished and will be finished soon. User can enter information of the assignment such as: 
1. Name
2. Related Courses
3. Type (Quiz, Short-Questions, Essay, etc.)
4. Due Date
5. Managed Start Time
6. Description (Optional)

Those assignments will be put on *Unfinished Assignments* part. After user has finished an assignment, he/she will enter finished time. Finally the assignment will be put on *Finished Assignments* part in order to let user review time spent on every assignments. Additional features include:
- Viewing assignment details (including its description)
- Editing informaiton and deleting assignment
- Sort the finished assignments by increasing/decreasing order of time spent
- Visualize the time spent on every courses using a bar chart

## Who will use it?

As assignments are done by students, also the application is designed for students, **all students** will be the target users for the application. After the application has successfully developed, it will first open to university students. If the application is operating well, it will then open to all other students.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

For a simple reason: I am also a student. As a student, one of the main source of stress comes from heavy workload of assignments. I need an app to help me keep track of the assignments to be done. Out of my curiosity, I would like to know how much time did I contribute on every assignment. Therefore, I have come up with this project to record the assignments I have done. Looking at time spent is helpful for my time management as I can reflect how much time I spent on each course.
